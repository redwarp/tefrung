## A 2d engine

Sure, let's write some kind of 2d engine.

What I'm aiming for:

* A simple API, with primitives:
  + draw sprites
  + draw rectangles, polygons, 
  + draw text, 

What I'm not aiming for:

* A full 2d game engine solution, with game loop, event handling, and so on.

This project is pretty much for learning, and because I think there is room for something really really simple to draw basic stuff.

## Examples

* [Sample](sample) - Random call to the api to validate it works.
* [Snake](snake) - A snake implementation.
